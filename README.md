🔥 Excited to share my latest project: a Python firewall simulator! 🚀

As part of my semester mini-project, I embarked on a journey to delve into the fundamentals of network security. 🛡️ Armed with Python, I crafted a basic firewall from scratch, bypassing the use of any libraries. 🐍

The core of my firewall lies in predefined rules, where I meticulously delineated between allowing and blocking IP packets. 📝 This hands-on approach not only deepened my understanding of network protocols but also honed my programming skills.

Throughout this endeavor, I encountered challenges and triumphs, each contributing to my growth as a budding cybersecurity enthusiast. 💪 Now, I'm thrilled to share the fruits of my labor with you all.
